# Projeto10790

This is intended to be a final project on a programing course as well as a first attempt to learn the WPF framework.
The project is for a simple store management software that implements loyalty cards, stock management and order managemnet features.
The Docs folder includes any files not directly used by the program but are part of the project such as the Entity Relationship Model, SQL scripts, etc..

The Project will be developed in C# and will utilize .NET 6.0 and the WPF framework.
