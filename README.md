# Projeto10790

This is intended to be a final project on a programing course as well as a first attempt to learn the WPF framework.
The project is for a simple store management software that implements loyalty cards, stock management and order managemnet features.
The Docs folder includes any files not directly used by the program but are part of the project such as the Entity Relationship Model, SQL scripts, etc..

The Project will be developed in C# and will utilize .NET 6.0 and the WPF framework.
Project laguage will be in english however fields like Tax ID, currency, contacts, etc... will be localized to Portugal with possible alteration to add more localizations in the future if time allows.
The database may include fields that are not used but may be in future versions, as such there may also be fields intended as Foreign Keys for non existent tables to leave room for their future implementation.
